## üì¶ Additional Context

- You are free to:
  - Add or refactor components
  - Use any form library/ prefereably react-hook-form or write custom validation
  - Choose how you persist new events (mock or memory)

---

## üß† Things to Consider

- Make assumptions where the spec is vague ‚Äî explain them if needed.
- Think like a senior: tradeoffs, maintainability, and developer experience matter.
- You can use tools like `json-server`, `react-hook-form`, `react-query`, etc., if justified.

---

## üïê Time Expectation

This test is designed to take **4‚Äì6 hours**. Please don't over-engineer. Just show your **approach, thinking, and quality**.

---

## üì¨ Submission

- Push your code to a GitHub repo (public or invite-only)
- Include a short `NOTES.md` explaining:
  - How to run the app
  - Decisions made
  - Tradeoffs or improvements you'd do with more time

```
